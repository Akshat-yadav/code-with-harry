laptop = ["ram", "battery", "hdd", "led", "wifi", "mouse", 227]

# print(laptop[6])

numbers = [2, 8, 9, 11, 67, 7]
# print(numbers[4])

# numbers.sort()    # Sort and reverse may change the original list parameter. Here we are using numbers name list.
# numbers.reverse()

print(numbers[1:4]) # We are getting output in list. Slicing also working here.
